# .vimrc

##Changes Made outside of .vimrc
Made change to __/share/vim/vim74/ftplugin/html.vim__
because it was conflicting with code folding in HTML files 
code folding is disabled on html files. Also html.vim 
to https://github.com/gregsexton/MatchTag.git for matching 
tags when editing HTML files
